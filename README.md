Sprint 7 project

In this project I wrote tests for 4 different HTTP methods - GET, POST, PUT & DELETE.
API Docs was the source used for the handlers.
I tested each request for two things: the response status code and expected date.
All of the tests were ran in VS Code and later pushed to GitHub using Source Control. 
The coding language is JavaScript.

Use \\ npx jest filename \\ for all the tests e.g. npx jest deleteHandlers.test.js (change the filename accordingly)
